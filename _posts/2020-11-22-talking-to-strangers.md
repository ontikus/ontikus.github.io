A couple of years ago, I was about to board a plane with no forms of entertainment at hand, and I was sure that I would not be able to sleep for even one minute during my 3 hour flight. So, I picked up the book with the most interesting title- [Outliers: The story of success](https://www.gladwellbooks.com/titles/malcolm-gladwell/outliers/9780316040341/) I could find at the airport bookstore. It turned out to be a great book and changed my view on many events in the world and my definition of success. That's how I found out about [Malcolm Gladwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Gladwell). 

## [Talking to Strangers ](https://www.gladwellbooks.com/titles/malcolm-gladwell/talking-to-strangers/9780316478526/) by [Malcolm Gladwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Gladwell) 

In his most recent book, Talking to Strangers, he talks about the famous case of [Sandra Bland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Sandra_Bland), a black woman who committed suicide in a Texas jail 3 days after she was arrested at a traffic stop. The central idea of the book is that we suffer from biases when we are communicating with strangers, and we are not aware of those shortcomings. He explains the 3 biases with striking examples ranging from CIA double agents to poet Sylvia Plath. In the final chapter, we turn to the Sandra Bland case once again, now equipped to understand what really went wrong in the interaction of Sandra Bland with the police officer. 

## Fidel Castro's revenge 
A Cuban spy defects to the US, and starts talking. He tells the officers at CIA, that almost every spy that worked for CIA in Cuba at the time was in fact a double agent feeding the information that was fabricated by Cuban officials and approved by Fidel Castro. For years, even the best agents in CIA had no idea. This situation was not an isolated case. Over the years, CIA faced many embarrassing stories involving double agents in many parts of the world. 

>Why can't we tell when a stranger in front of us is lying to our face? 

## Getting to know der Fuhrer 
Many high-ranking officials and politicians, including the then Prime Minister of England, repeatedly met with Hitler and spent much time with him. But almost all of them misjudged his intentions about invading Chekoslovakia. After each meeting, they believed that Hitler is a reasonable man, he does not want to enter into war. 

In fact, the people who followed Hitler from the news and other intelligence reports had much better view of his intentions than the people who spent time with him face to face. When people meet with strangers, they think they can discover the stranger's intentions, and make out if he's lying or not. But, that is almost never the case as this book tries to prove. 

When judges decide if they should set a high bail, or release the defendant, they misjudge most of the time how likely the defendant is to commit another crime while he/she is outside. Similarly, orchestras make better hiring decisions if they audition the candidates behind screens. In other words, seeing the musicians or the defendant does not help, but hurt the decision-making. 

> We have a conviction that we know others better than others know us. We think we can easily see into people with just minimal clues. We are very quick to judge strangers. But, strangers are not easy. 

## Default to truth 
One of the best and the brightest Cuba analysts in the CIA also turned out to be a double agent. Once again, for years no one saw it coming. Even though there were many warnings and red flags about her, the management chose to ignore and explain them away. 

Here the book talks about an experiment made by [Tim Levine](http://timothy-levine.squarespace.com/deception/). The experiment set up entices the subjects to cheat, then interrogate them about the cheating. Then, another set of subjects watch the interrogation videos and decide who among the videos lied and who told the truth.  

This experiment shows that when we face a situation where we have to decide if we are being lied to, we default to truth. We assume, we try to explain away the warning signs to the point that they become unexplainable. Only after our suspicions overcome a certain threshold, we decide that what we hear are lies. 

## The holy fool 
This part demonstrates the *default-to-truth* principle that was introduced before. It goes over the [Sandusky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Sandusky) and other child abuse cases. It talks about how the officials, supervisors, parents, and even the victims themselves defaulted to truth when they are faced with  reports and allegations of abuse. The key witness in the Sandusky case denied any wrongdoing on Sandusky's part, he even invited Sandusky to his wedding. Years later, he visited Sandusky's home to show his son. 

In the [Nassar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Nassar) case, co-workers and friends still thought that he was wrongfully accused even after the police found 30 000 child pornography photos on his computer. 

In the Sandusky case, 2 of his supervisors were charged with conspiracy because they ignored the reports of possible child abuse. The president of the university wowed to protect them, because he thought they were wrongfully accused. We think we want our managers, employers, and police officers to be vigilant and want them to never to default to truth, be suspicious of every one all the time. But, in reality, we want them to protect us in times of adversity, like the president tried to protect his employees against the accusations. 

## The transparency fallacy 
Transparency in this context is the idea that you can read what people actually feel from their facial expression and demeanor. But, experiments show that people may show different expressions or behave differently from one another. Some people even lack some expressions. For example, when some people are in fear, their face may become blank, appearing to an observer as cold, heartless, or brave. However, they may be extremely afraid at that moment. We think we are very good at identifying people's emotions from their facial expressions. But, in fact, those readings are flawed, and mislead us most of the time. 
> The paradox of talking to strangers: we need to talk to them. But, we are terrible at it and we are not honest with one another about how terrible at it we are. 

## A short explanation of the Amanda Knox Case
Amanda Knox's roommate is killed and she becomes the prime suspect in the murder investigation mainly because she reacts to tragedy from what people expect. We go back to Levine's experiments mentioned above. The experiments aim to see if people can tell liars from honest people. The experiments show that we judge people based on their demeanor. Well-spoken, confident people with a firm handshake who are friendly are seen as believable. 

We also believe that people are transparent. So, if their behavior matches our idea of how a liar should behave, we think they are lying. We can identify correctly only if an honest person acts as an honest person, or a liar looks like a liar. But, we fail miserably when there's a *mismatch*. That is, if a liar acts like an honest person, or an honest person looks like a liar. In Knox case, she was very angry instead of sad when she found out that her roommate had been killed. Therefore, people saw her as cold-hearted and assumed that she was somehow involved in the murder. 

According to Levine's experiments, the failure to identify *mismatched* people is common in law enforcement agents, police, judges. This shows that even professional *lie detectors* fail to identify liars correctly. 

> But you are trying to find the answer in my eyes ... You are looking at me .. Why? These are my eyes. They are not objective evidence. *Amanda Knox*
