I **love** chicken wings. They are salty, crunchy, spicy, juicy, go great with beer, low on carbohydrates -except for the beer-. I first got hooked when I was in the US. Everywhere I live, I look for a bar that offers good chicken wings and good beer. In my opinion, wings must satisfy the following conditions: 
  * Crunchy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Seinfeld lovers, [see Kramer's choice of plums](https://youtu.be/ShwJBi08tkI?t=20)
  * Has a hot sauce that is not very spicy, but it burns your nose when you inhale the sauce. It has a specific taste that is close to Tabasco. 
  * Must be served with blue cheese or ranch dressing and celery sticks. 
  * Must be served with a cold bottle of IPA. 

But, that's very hard to come by. In most places, the wings come either dead-dry, or mushy and uncooked. There was only [one place](http://blackharppub.ru/) I could find that comes close to the ideal. With the corona situation, going there is a distant dream for now. 

That's why I jumped to the opportunity to make chicken wings at home. I was promised that it would taste great and I would not have to deep fry anything.

Kenji's video below explains everything you need to know. I only have a just a little note. The recipe calls for 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of baking soda per pound of chicken. It comes about to **7 grams of salt and 7 grams of baking soda per kilogram of chicken**. I would put a little bit more baking soda (~10-12 gr. per kg.).

*Note: I was able to buy [Frank's Original Redhot](https://www.franksredhot.com/en-us) sauce at the supermarket. Major online retailers carry it, so you can order online depending on your location.*  

If you want to add an easy-to-make ranch dressing as a side, please watch [Kenji's POV video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8nJIiQo7jw).
