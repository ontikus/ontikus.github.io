* Intro to chicken wings. I love chicken wings. They are salty, crunchy, spicy, juicy, go great with beer, low on carbohydrates -except for the beer-. I first got hooked when I was in the US. I look for a good place that offers good chicken wings and good beer everywhere I live. I can eat chicken wings non-stop if they satisfy the following conditions: 
    * Crunchy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Seinfeld lovers, [see Kramer's choice of plums](https://youtu.be/ShwJBi08tkI?t=20)
    * Has a hot sauce that is not very spicy, but it burns your nose when you inhale the sauce. It has a specific taste that is close to Tabasco. 
    * Served with blue cheese or ranch dressing and celery sticks. 
    * A cold IPA. 

But, that's very hard to come by. In most places, the wings come either dead-dry, or mushy and uncooked. There was only [one place](http://blackharppub.ru/) I could find that comes close to the ideal. Withe corona situation, it is a distant dream for now. 

That's why I jumped to the opportunity to make chicken wings at home with and added bonus: I was promised that it would taste great and I would not have to deep fry anything.

Kenji's video basically tells everything that you need to know. I only have a just a little note. The recipe calls for 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of baking soda per pound of chicken. It comes about to **7 grams of salt and 7 grams of baking soda per kilogram of chicken**. I would put a little bit more baking soda (~10-12 gr. per kg.).

* Interpretations of chicken wings in the world 
    * US: Deep fried with hot sauce. The sauce is not extremely hot, but burns inside your nose when you inhale the vapors. It's crunchy on the outside, yet juicy on the inside. 
    * Russia: An imitation of the American chicken wings, with local additions. It comes out either dead-dry, or mushy and uncooked. There is only [one place](http://blackharppub.ru/) that comes close to offering American style wings.  
    * Turkey: Turkish wings are marinated in hot pepper paste and grilled on a [mangal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangal_%28barbecue%29). Although I enjoy this because I love bbq, still it does not come close to the American style. 
* Kenji and the video 
* Things to look out for. 
    * The key is to toss the wings with salt and baking soda mix and leave them to dry in the refrigerator for **24 hours**.
