I have been sending pictures of the meals I cook to my friends on whatsapp. Many of them ask questions, I then respond to each individual question, then keep having the same conversations in different chat groups with different friends. The idea of having a blog started with trying to avoid extra conversations. Hopefully, I will have one blog post to tell my story to all my friends simultaneously. 

I also try to take notes while reading books, then make a short summary about the books for friends/family who are too lazy to read the book. So, you may see some of them here, too -I admit that I don't read that many books, so book posts will be a rarity. 

A bit about me:
* Jack of all trades, master of none
* Lifelong expat, immigrant, *gurbet√ßi*
* Recovering TV addict 


The posts will be in **English** or **Turkish**.
